<div class="main-header">
  <p><span class='script'> It's 5:30 on a Tuesday</span>.  I need to have dinner ready in an hour.
    I don't have a taste for anything specific and I don't want to waste
    time combing through a recipe book or that list of favorites I have somewhere
    on Google Drive.  Plus, maybe one of my not lazy friends has been
    making something interesting lately.  So, what am I eating?</p>

      <h1><a href="{% url 'post_detail' pk=post.pk %}">{{ post.title }}</a></h1>
      <p>published: {{ post.published_date }} by
        <a href={% url 'author_detail' pk=post.author.pk %}>{{ post.author }}</a></p>
      <p>{{ post.text|linebreaksbr }}</p>
